Your Twitch chat controls your Minecraft server!

# How it works: for streamers

1. Set up a Minecraft server (version **1.9 or higher**, can be vanilla or modified server!)
2. Edit your `server.properties` file to the following settings:
   ```
   enable-rcon=true
   rcon.password=your_rcon_password_here
   rcon.port=your_rcon_port_default_is_25575_here
   broadcast-rcon-to-ops=false
   ```

3. You're done! Start your Minecraft server and Twitch livestream and enjoy the pain.
